## Chapter 3

- Alternative version control systems are: 
  1. Bazaar
  2. AWD Code Commit
  3. Mercurial
  4. Concurrent version systems
  5. Subversion
- With each system, a special future is:
  1.  Bazaar is a distributed version control system, meaning every user has a full copy of the repository, including its history.
  2. AWS CodeCommit stands out for its secure, scalable, and fully-managed capabilities
  3. Mercurial is known for its simplicity and performance 
  4. Concurrent version systems are system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
  5. Subversion (SVN) is an open-source centralized version control system designed to manage and track changes to files and directories over time.
- Mercurial: Mercurial may be preferred over git in situations where simplicity, performance with large repositories, and consistent user experience are top priorities.
